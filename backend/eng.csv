1,Beyond PTSD: Client presentations of developmental trauma disorder from a national survey of clinicians.,PTSD; abuse; trauma; DTD,"Jonathan DePierro, Wendy D'Andrea, Joseph Spinazzola, Erin Stafford, Bessel van Der Kolk, Glenn Saxe, Bradley Stolbach, Scott McKernan, Julian D Ford",2022,PTSD,"The emergence of updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM–5]; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which includes modified criteria for young children, raises questions regarding the need for developmentally appropriate standalone psychiatric diagnosis encompassing complex trauma presentations in children. The present study addresses these questions by examining how DSM–5 PTSD and proposed developmental trauma disorder (DTD) diagnoses relate to functional impairment and trauma exposure using clinician-report surveys. Method: We surveyed psychotherapists across the United States, and asked them to report on the symptom characteristics, functional impairment, and trauma exposure of children, adolescents, and young adults under their care (n = 210; age range = 2–21). We fit symptom data to the draft criteria for (1) DTD, a proposed trauma diagnosis for children and (2) existing criteria for adult and child/preschool PTSD. Results: Results indicated that comorbidity between DTD and PTSD was high (52.4% and 59.9% for adult and child/preschool criteria, respectively). Comorbid DTD/PTSD and DTD-alone groups had more functional domains impacted and greater exposure to some types of trauma relative to the other groups. Conclusions: These findings speak to the relationship between trauma complexity and wide-ranging symptom presentations, provide support for research and clinical emphasis on a developmentally informed diagnosis, and may support existing treatment approaches.",english
2,Posttraumatic stress and alexithymia: A meta-analysis of presentation and severity.,"
alexithymia; PTSD; trauma; difficulties identifying feelings; posttraumatic stress",Emily R Edwards,2022,PTSD,"Improving treatment outcomes for posttraumatic stress necessitates consideration of factors that may impede treatment progress. Previous research suggests alexithymia—an emotion-processing deficit characterized by difficulties in identifying, describing, and attending to emotional information—may be a therapeutically relevant correlate of posttraumatic stress. Method: Building upon previous work in this area, meta-analysis was used to investigate (a) how alexithymic traits typically present among those with a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis, (b) the strength of association between alexithymic trait severity and posttraumatic stress severity independent of diagnosis, and (c) alexithymia subdimensions most closely associated with posttraumatic stress. A total of 43 samples encompassing 5,069 participants were included in analyses. Results: Results suggest individuals diagnosed with PTSD tend to experience alexithymic traits that, while just below the clinical cutoff, are 1.32 standard deviations more severe than the general population. These alexithymic traits are particularly prominent in male and veteran samples and for difficulties in identifying feelings. Independent of diagnosis, posttraumatic stress was moderately associated with alexithymic traits, and stronger associations were noted between posttraumatic stress and difficulties in identifying feelings than between posttraumatic stress and difficulties in describing feelings or externally oriented thinking. Conclusions: Results attest to the importance of considering, conceptualizing, and treating posttraumatic stress and alexithymia in tandem. Implications for ongoing treatment development for posttraumatic stress are discussed.",english
3,Understanding the relationship between interpersonal trauma and disordered eating: An extension of the model of psychological adaptation.,"
schemas; interpersonal trauma; disordered eating","Samantha C Holmes, Nicole L Johnson, Dawn M Johnson",2022,ED,"Interpersonal trauma is a nonspecific risk factor for disordered eating (DE). Studies have begun to examine mechanisms that explain the relationship; however, few have tested comprehensive theoretical models. The Model of Psychological Adaptation (McCann, Sakheim, & Abrahamson, 1988) posits that trauma exposure results in core schema disruptions that are associated with varying psychological response patterns, or psychological adaptations, that are also established predictors of DE, such as interpersonal and affective problems. The model has been successfully applied to symptoms of other psychological disorders, such as PTSD and depression, but has not previously been extended to predict DE. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by assessing an extension of the Model of Psychological Adaptation to DE. Method: A sample of 371 undergraduate women completed an online survey. Results: Using structural equation modeling, the results of the current study demonstrated positive fit for a model that represents the extension of the Model of Psychological Adaptation to DE. Conclusion: These findings corroborate the link between interpersonal trauma and DE, thus demonstrating the potential importance of assessing for DE symptoms among clients who have survived interpersonal trauma and attending to trauma history among clients who have DE. In addition, it highlights mechanisms that may be relevant to the conceptualization and treatment of DE among survivors of interpersonal trauma.",english
4,"Embodied cognition and emotion, two variables improving memory abilities in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.","
emotion; enactment; memory performance; Parkinson’s disease; Alzheimer’s disease","Romane Croze, Domitille Dilly, Marielle Godeau, Zineb Bouazza, Jean-Claude Getenet, Hanna Chainay, Céline Borg",2022,ND,"This study investigated whether emotions and enactment can jointly increase memory performance in nondemented Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Method: Actions’ drawings with negative, positive, or neutral valence were presented to 17 PD patients, 17 AD patients, and 37 elderly controls, matched to age. Two conditions of intentional encoding were proposed to each participant: one verbal, in which participants had to name the represented actions; and one motor, in which they had to mime the displayed actions. Thereafter, participants were submitted to an immediate free recall task and a delayed recognition task. Results: The enactment effect was found in all three groups. The effect of emotion was also observed in that all three groups recalled negative actions better than both neutral and positive (PD patients), only neutral (AD patients), or only positive actions (elderly controls). Positive actions were not recalled better than neutral actions in any group. Conclusions: These results constitute an evidence for the preservation of the enactment effect and of the emotion effect on memory in AD and PD patients. However, they do not support the hypothesis of the combined effect of emotion and enactment on memory, neither in AD and PD patients nor in normal aging.",english
5,Cardiac-disease-induced posttraumatic stress symptoms (CDI-PTSS) among cardiac patients’ partners: A longitudinal study.,ACE; PTSD; PTSS; partners; fear of illness progression,"Eisenberg Roni, Fait Keren, Dekel Rachel, Levi Nitza, Hod Hanoch, Matezki Shlomi, Vilchinsky Noa",2022,PTSD,"Cardiac-disease-induced posttraumatic stress symptoms (CDI-PTSS) have been detected among a substantial number of cardiac patients. Even though patients’ caregiving partners are also susceptible to CDI-PTSS, the research on cardiac partners’ CDI-PTSS is scarce. Based on the ecological model of trauma and recovery, we investigated levels of partners’ CDI-PTSS over time, and factors that potentially contribute to it. Method: During patients’ hospitalizations, partners (N = 143) provided data regarding demographic variables and peritraumatic emotional distress (depression and anxiety). Four months later, partners’ CDI-PTSS, their emotional distress, fear of patients’ illness progression, and perceived social support were assessed. Eight months posthospitalization, partners filled out questionnaires tapping CDI-PTSS. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: A mild level of CDI-PTSS was detected among partners, 4 and 8 months after patients’ cardiac event. Partners’ distress as measured during patients’ hospitalization, and their fear of patients’ illness progression, contributed to the manifestation of CDI-PTSS over time. Conclusions: The findings shed light on potential risk factors for partners’ CDI-PTSS. Interventions to ameliorate partners’ distress and fear of illness progression should be designed toward reducing the development of CDI-PTSS among partners.",english
6,Metacognitive strategy training versus psychoeducation for improving fatigue in children and adolescents with acquired brain injuries: A randomized controlled trial.,fatigue; pediatric brain injury; fatigue management; cognitive rehabilitation,"Hypher Ruth, Brandt Anne Elisabeth, Skovlund Eva, Skarbø Anne-Britt, Barder Helene Eidsmo, Andersson Stein, Rø Torstein Baade, Risnes Kari, Finnanger Torun Gangaune, Stubberud Jan",2022,ND,"The present study aims to explore the relative effectiveness of two group-based cognitive rehabilitation programs for reducing fatigue in pediatric acquired brain injury (pABI). Method: This is an exploratory study of secondary endpoints in a blinded, parallel-randomized controlled trial with children and adolescents (ages 10–17 years) with pABI and reported executive dysfunction. It investigates the effectiveness of a metacognitive program (pediatric goal management training, n = 36) compared to a psychoeducational program (pediatric brain health workshop, n = 37) for reducing fatigue (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Multidimensional Fatigue Scale), 8 weeks and 6 months postintervention. Results: Seventy-three participants completed the allocated interventions, and 71 attended the 6-month follow-up. The results showed a significant decrease in parent-reported fatigue for both interventions from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. Forty percent of the total sample had a reliable change. There was no significant difference between the intervention groups, but a tendency in favor of the psychoeducational approach. Only subscales cognitive and sleep/rest fatigue showed significant reductions. In regression analyses, several factors predicted fatigue at 6 months follow-up, but only better global outcome and executive attention predicted a decrease in fatigue symptoms after 6 months. Conclusions: Group-based cognitive rehabilitation in the chronic phase of pABI, including education of parents and teachers, may be helpful in reducing fatigue. Global outcome and executive attention at baseline predicted fatigue improvement. Developmental factors are important to consider when tailoring pediatric interventions, as well as modifiable factors associated with fatigue.

7,A Web-Based Positive Psychology App for Patients With Bipolar Disorder: Development Study,"Bipolar disorder;
Focus groups;
Empowerment;
Mental disorders","Bart Geerling, Saskia M Kelders, Anja W M M Stevens, Ralph W Kupka, Ernst T Bohlmeijer ",2022,BD,"This study aimed to gain insight into the opinions of patients with BD and health care professionals about (web-based) PPIs for BD and to develop and pilot-test an app containing PPIs specifically designed for patients with BD.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Center for eHealth and Disease Management road map principles and incorporated cocreation and designing for implementation. Data were collected using focus group discussions, questionnaires, rapid prototyping, and web-based feedback on a prototype from the participants. In total, 3 focus groups were conducted with 62% (8/13) of patients with BD and 38% (5/13) of professionals. The collected data were used to develop a smartphone app containing short PPIs. The content was based on PPIs for which a solid base of evidence is available. Finally, a pilot test was conducted to test the app.
Focus groups revealed that PPIs as part of the current BD treatment can potentially meet the following needs: offering hope, increasing self-esteem, expressing feelings, acceptance, and preventing social isolation. Some patients expressed concern that PPIs may provoke a manic or hypomanic episode by increasing positive affect. The pilot of the app showed that the PPIs are moderately to highly valued by the participants. There were no adverse effects such as increase in manic or hypomanic symptoms.
With the systematic use of user involvement (patients and professionals) in all steps of the development process, we were able to create an app that can potentially fulfill some of the current unmet needs in the treatment of BD. We reached consensus among consumers and professionals about the potential benefits of PPIs to address the unmet needs of patients with BD. The use of PPI for BD is intriguing and can be usefully explored in further studies. We emphasize that more evaluation studies (quantitative and qualitative) that are focused on the effect of PPIs in the treatment of BD should be conducted. In addition, to establish the working mechanisms in BD, explorative, qualitative, designed studies are required to reveal whether PPIs can address unmet needs in BD.",english
8,PTSD in autistic adults: Correlates of meeting DSM–5 criteria and predictors of professional diagnosis.,PTSD; diagnosis; autism spectrum disorders; autistic adults; gender differences,"Reuben Katherine E., Self-Brown Shannon, Vinoski Thomas Erin",2022,"PTSD, ND","Although many autistic adults show high posttraumatic stress, PTSD is underdiagnosed in this population. This study aims to examine correlates of autistic adults screening positive for PTSD (PTSD +) and predictors of a professional PTSD diagnosis (Diagnosis +) in the PTSD + subgroup. Method: Self-identified autistic adults (N = 677) completed an online survey on their demographic characteristics, mental health symptoms, and trauma history. T tests and chi-squares were used to compare subgroups, and logistic regression was used to predict diagnosis status. Results: PTSD + participants were less likely to be employed or to identify as cisgender men, had more mental health symptoms and worse functional impairment, and had experienced a higher number of traumas and more interpersonal trauma. The same was true for Diagnosis + participants, who were also older and more likely to have a marginalized racial/ethnic identity. Among participants who were PTSD +, older age, being a woman or gender minority, being unemployed or on disability, having increased posttraumatic stress, having more co-occurring conditions, and having lower functional impairment predicted being Diagnosis +. The final model explained 35% of variance in diagnosis. Conclusion: PTSD is associated with significant impairment in autistic adults, but it often goes unrecognized. In particular, autistic cisgender men might be underdiagnosed with PTSD because of gendered stereotypes. High functional impairment may also increase barriers to obtaining an appropriate diagnosis. Future research should include participant treatment history as a potential factor. Clinicians should be aware of these potential signs of PTSD and diagnostic barriers when working with autistic clients. ",english
9,Assessing depression outcomes in teletherapy for underserved residents in Central Texas: Telehealth’s move to treatment-as-usual.,treatment-as-usual; rural; telepsychology; community mental health; psychotherapy outcomes,"Armstrong Trey W., McCord Carly E., Stickley Mariah M., George Nevita, Elliott Timothy R.",2022,DP,"Telehealth is a flexible and cost-effective solution for providing psychotherapy services. The present study examines teletherapy outcomes data using two methodological frameworks: a categorical outcome approach, clinically significant change (CSC), and a continuous outcome approach, latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM). Archival data from 424 rural-residing clients were analyzed. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were fitted in two ways of comparison. The level of change was also explored and was modeled at five points as well as six points. A latent growth mixture model was fitted to assess depression severity over time. Clients achieved either CSC or overall improvement on the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 after three–seven sessions. Session-to-session results indicated that change took longer (10–11 sessions). Reliable deterioration was infrequently experienced and, thus, difficult to model. The LGMM fit best with three classes, of which two started clinically and varied in their improvement rates. The third class started nonclinically and showed little improvement over time. This study advances the literature regarding outcomes for rural clients by utilizing the frame of treatment-as-usual psychotherapy effectiveness and providing more generalizability to this specific population.",english
10,A meta-analysis of sandplay therapy treatment outcomes.,sandplay therapy; sandtray therapy; play therapy; Dora Kalff,"Wiersma Jacquelyn K., Freedle Lorraine R., McRoberts Rachel, Solberg Kenneth B.",2022,"AD, PTSD, ND, Treatment","Sandplay therapy is a cross-cultural, psychodynamic, nondirective, multisensory psychotherapy method founded by Dora Kalff. Sandplay is used with children and adults with a range of mental health problems. Despite sandplay’s growing popularity, its empirical evidence base is less developed than more well-known therapies. This international study provides a meta-analysis of the available quantitative outcome studies in order to summarize the growing evidence base of sandplay. The meta-analysis specifically examined emotional and behavioral outcome measures of treatment with sandplay therapy. The initial search identified 1,715 potential records from over 16 countries. After screening, 40 studies from eight countries representing 1,284 participants met the inclusion criteria. Mean effect sizes were calculated using a random effects model with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) program. The overall effect size was large (Hedges’ g = 1.10). Large effect sizes were maintained for internalizing, externalizing, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Improved effect sizes were associated with individual treatment over the group format. These results suggest that sandplay therapy is an effective treatment method for children and adults with a wide variety of mental health concerns. Limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed. ",english

In the field of psychotherapy, research has yielded inconsistent results regarding the association between experience and therapy outcome. However, this research was mostly conducted cross-sectionally. A longitudinal study from the U.S. recently indicated that psychotherapists’ experience was not associated with therapy outcomes. The present study aimed at replicating Goldberg, Rousmaniere, et al. (2016) study in the German healthcare system. Using routine evaluation data of a large German university psychotherapy outpatient clinic, the effect of N = 241 therapists’ experience on the outcomes of their patients (N = 3,432) was assessed longitudinally using linear and logistic multilevel modeling. Experience was operationalized using the number of days since the first patient of a therapist as well as using the number of patients treated beforehand. Outcome criteria were defined as change in general psychopathology as well as response, remission, and early termination. Several covariates (number of sessions per case, licensure, and main diagnosis) were also examined. Across all operationalizations of experience (time since first patient and number of cases treated) and therapy outcome (change in psychopathology, response, remission, and early termination), results largely suggest no association between therapists’ experience and therapy outcome. Preliminary evidence suggests that therapists need fewer sessions to achieve the same outcomes when they gain more experience. Therapeutic experience seems to be unrelated to patients’ change in psychopathology. This lack of findings is of importance for improving postgraduate training and the quality of psychotherapy in general.",english

Background: Practice effects are common in repeated neuropsychological testing. Not accounting for practice effects may obscure cognitive decline in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Method: We developed standardized regression-based change norms from normative samples consisting of healthy controls from the Dementia Disease Initiation study (n = 125), the Trønderbrain study (n = 57), and the Gothenburg mild cognitive impairment (MCI) study (n = 65). Norms were applied in a sample with cognitive symptoms (subjective cognitive decline or MCI) and AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (n = 246), classified according to the A/T/N system. Results: The change norms adjusted for pertinent demographics and practice effects. The group with cognitive complaints displayed a trend toward cognitive decline compared to the normative group, with the A +T/N + subgroup showing the most marked decline. This was observed in tests of episodic memory and cognitive flexibility/divided attention. Conclusions: We present 2-year cognitive change norms for adults between 41 and 84 years, adjusted for practice and demographics. A web-based change norm calculator is provided. ",english
13,Adapting Dialectical Behavior Therapy for the Treatment of Dissociative Identity Disorder,dialectical behavior therapy; dissociative identity disorder; dissociation; dissociative behaviors; self-harm,"BRAD FOOTE, KIM VAN ORDEN",2022,Schizophrenia,"Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), created by Marsha Linehan, has been shown to be an effective therapy for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and for suicidal and self-harming behavior. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a complex post-traumatic disorder which is highly comorbid with BPD, shares a number of clinical features with BPD, and which like BPD features a high degree of suicidality. The DID treatment literature emphasizes the importance of a staged approach, beginning with the creation of a safe therapeutic frame prior to addressing traumatic material; DBT is also a staged treatment, in which behavioral and safety issues are addressed in Stage 1, and trauma work reserved for Stage 2. The authors describe adapting DBT, and especially its techniques for Stage 1 safety work, for work with DID patients. Basic theoretical principles are described and illustrated with a case example.",english

This therapeutic approach has elements familiar to experienced therapists, but is specific in its conceptualization. What distinguishes this therapy from others is the induction and utilization of a special positive quality in the therapeutic relationship as a therapeutic aim and ""curative factor"" in its own right, beyond its role as the substrate for the trusting relationship that underlies all successful psychotherapeutic treatments. (Viederman, 2011) This involves a specific strategy and technique designed to develop a ""benevolent transference"" to effect change, to achieve symptom relief, and sometimes, as a precursor to meaningful insight. In this respect the relationship, considered to be a central feature of the therapy, complements understanding as a vehicle for change. A variety of interventions described to facilitate this process will be illustrated with different types of patients.",english

Child psychological factors, including internal and external symptoms, were commonly associated with all types of headaches. Sleep disturbances showed a positive association with headaches in 3 out of 5 studies. Family conflict and unhappiness were frequently found in children suffering with headaches, while single-parent families and divorce were not associated. Stressful environments and adverse life events, particularly bullying, were also found to be linked with headaches. Childhood headaches represent an alarm bell for clinicians to investigate and treat psychological or psychiatric disorders in children and their family.

Method: In October 2021, we conducted a 2 (Illness Description: long COVID vs. ongoing COVID-19 recovery) × 2 (Symptom Uncertainty: uncertainty emphasized vs. not emphasized) × 2 (Efficacy of Support: enhanced vs. basic support) between-subjects randomized online experimental study. Participants (N = 1,110) were presented with a scenario describing a positive COVID-19 test result, followed by one of eight scenarios describing a long COVID diagnosis and then completed outcome measures of illness expectations including: symptom severity, symptom duration, quality of life, personal control, treatment control, and illness coherence. Results: We ran a series of 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVAs on the outcome variables. We found a main effect of illness description: individuals reported longer symptom duration and less illness coherence when the illness was described as long COVID (compared to ongoing COVID-19 recovery). There was a main effect of symptom uncertainty: when uncertainty was emphasized, participants reported longer expected symptom duration (p < .001), less treatment control (p = .031), and less illness coherence (p < .001) than when uncertainty was not emphasized. There was a main effect of efficacy of support: participants reported higher personal control (p = .004) and higher treatment control (p = .037) when support was enhanced (compared to basic support). Conclusions: Communications around long COVID should avoid emphasizing symptom uncertainty and aim to provide people with access to additional support and information on how they can facilitate their recovery.

However, the nature of this postulated timing issue has not been well specified and the existing experimental literature has generated mixed findings. In the current study, we attempted a systematic investigation of timing processes in autistic adults using scalar expectancy theory as a theoretical framework. Autistic (n = 58) and nonautistic (n = 91) adults matched for age, sex, and full-scale IQ completed a battery of auditory and visual timing tasks measuring basic subsecond duration perception (temporal discrimination thresholds), clock processes (verbal estimation), clock and memory processes (temporal generalization), and event timing (temporal order judgments). Participants also completed suprasecond retrospective duration estimates where the participant was not warned in advanced that they would be required to make a timing judgment, and questionnaires measuring self-reported timing behaviors in daily life. The groups reported differences on questionnaires, but measures of timing performance were comparable overall. In an exploratory analysis, we performed principal components analysis to investigate the relationship between timing judgments and participants’ self-reported social-communicative, sensory, and motor traits. Measures of timing performance were not well correlated with these questionnaire scores. The current study, the largest conducted on time and autism to date, shows no clear evidence for reduced timing performance in autistic adults.

Considering this cultural context provides insight for tailoring and implementing interventions in a culturally competent manner.

Participants were general ward nurses (n = 101) and the general population (n = 116) in the United Kingdom who completed a survey for this cross-sectional study. Nurses reported poorer contact experiences with people with mental illness (less frequent positive contact, more frequent negative contact, lower contact quality, fewer friendships) than the general population. They also reported greater stigma (more negative attitudes, higher attribution of negative and lower attribution of positive human uniqueness traits to people with mental illness, greater differences between themselves and people with mental illness, lower behavioral intentions). Intergroup anxiety and intergroup empathy mediated the associations between group and contact quality, attitudes as well as behavioral intentions.

To answer this question properly, the field needs to understand the meaningful heterogeneity in effects. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on two key moderators with adequate data to test: Subsamples expected to benefit most and implementation fidelity. We also specified a process model that can be generative for theory. We included articles published between 2002 (first mindset intervention) through the end of 2020 that reported an effect for a growth mindset intervention, used a randomized design, and featured at least one of the qualifying outcomes. Our search yielded 53 independent samples testing distinct interventions. We reported cumulative effect sizes for multiple outcomes (i.e., mindsets, motivation, behavior, end results), with a focus on three primary end results (i.e., improved academic achievement, mental health, or social functioning). Multilevel metaregression analyses with targeted subsamples and high fidelity for academic achievement yielded, d = 0.14, 95% CI [.06, .22]; for mental health, d = 0.32, 95% CI [.10, .54]. Results highlighted the extensive variation in effects to be expected from future interventions. Namely, 95% prediction intervals for focal effects ranged from −0.08 to 0.35 for academic achievement and from 0.07 to 0.57 for mental health. The literature is too nascent for moderators for social functioning, but average effects are d = 0.36, 95% CI [.03, .68], 95% PI [−.50, 1.22].

This article explores barriers in linking people who use drugs (PWUD) into drug treatment facilities in urban, suburban, and rural areas of Connecticut, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. Between December 2018 and March 2020, study teams in the three states conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with key informants involved in programs to divert PWUD from criminal justice involvement including police, lawyers, judges, and others who work in drug treatment courts, and substance use disorder treatment providers who received referrals from and worked with police diversion programs or drug courts. Police diversion programs and drug treatment courts showed intraprogram variation in the structure of their programs in the three states and in different counties within the states. Structural barriers to successfully linking PWUD to treatment included a lack of resources, for example, a limited number of treatment facilities available, difficulties in funding mandated treatment, particularly in Wisconsin where Medicaid expansion has not occurred, and PWUDs’ need for additional services such as housing. Many police officers, judges, and others within drug treatment court, including drug treatment specialists, hold stigmatizing attitudes toward medications to treat opioid use disorder (MOUD) and are unlikely to recommend or actively refer to MOUD treatment. Drug courts and police diversion programs offer a welcome shift from prior emphases on criminalization of drug use. However, for such programs to be effective, more resources must be dedicated to their success. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",english

Method: We conducted semistructured interviews with purposefully sampled women who reported DES using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Twelve veterans (Mage = 54.0, SD = 8.38 years, 83.3% Caucasian, MEDE-Q Total = 3.87, SD = .77) enrolled in Veterans Health Administration primary care participated. Interviews gathered opinions on weight, appearance, and eating behaviors; experiences and preferences in addressing DES; and opinions on ways to improve their health care experience. Responses were analyzed via a directed content analysis that utilized a priori codes pertaining to health care utilization and compensatory health beliefs. Results: Results revealed longstanding DES of various types, including those consistent with restriction, binge eating, and bulimia. However, past experiences with symptom management primarily involved self-management vs. clinical management. Participants also endorsed multiple perceived treatment facilitators and barriers. Among facilitators were strong provider relationships, patient-centered communications, personalized goal setting, and skill-focused whole-person care. Barriers included feeling judged by others (including providers), amotivation, and financial and time limitations. Discussion: While IPC may be an important venue to identify and treat DES, multiple factors are likely to influence patients’ use of these services. Future work should explore the potential for multidisciplinary IPC teams to address DES. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",english
23,Can you find it? Novel oddity detection task for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.,neuroimaging; Alzheimer’ s disease; perirhinal cortex; early diagnosis; visual discrimination,"Frei Marlen, Berres Manfred, Kivisaari Sasa L., Henzen Nicolas A., Monsch Andreas U., Reinhardt Julia, Blatow Maria, Kressig Reto W., Krumm Sabine",2022,ND,"We aimed to develop a measure to specifically assess the functioning of the perirhinal cortex (PRC), a brain structure affected very early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. In this novel task, participants were shown arrays of six complex figures and had to identify the “odd-one.” Method: The pilot study included 50 normal controls (NCs) and 50 patients in very early stages of AD. Participants completed the task and received MRI scanning. Best differentiating items were determined and applied in a validation study including 25 NCs, 27 early-stage AD patients, and 26 patients with major depression. Logistic regression models investigated if task performance predicted group membership. Task performance was then related to whole-brain gray matter integrity. As proof of concept, cortical thickness values of four regions of interest (ROIs; e.g., medial PRC and entorhinal cortex [ERC]) were compared between the groups. The associations of task performance and cortical thickness of the ROIs were investigated using linear models. Results: Task performance showed good discriminative ability between early-stage AD patients and NCs. Whole-brain analyses revealed four significant clusters (p < .001) with peak voxels in parahippocampal regions including PRC and ERC. ROI analyses showed distinctly reduced cortical thickness in the AD group compared to both other groups in the medial PRC and ERC (p ≤ .001). Task performance modeled by ROI cortical thickness did not achieve significant results. Conclusion: Although further validation is needed, especially with age-matched participant groups, these findings indicate that the task detects early cognitive impairment related to AD.

24,Structural barriers and facilitators to mental health services for international aid workers.,trauma; aid workers; mental health; access and utilization,"Nerenberg Chava, Kia-Keating Maryam",2022,Treatment,"nternational aid workers provide critical services to millions of people around the world who are facing conflict, poverty, disease, and natural disasters. As such, aid workers routinely encounter danger and adversity, and endure negative mental health sequelae, including traumatic stress. While aid organizations have begun to provide psychosocial support services to their employees, the barriers and facilitators impacting aid workers’ access to mental health resources and services are understudied, and it is unclear how organizational actions facilitate or impede aid worker utilization of these services. Fourteen international aid workers participated in 90-min semistructured interviews and reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify key themes from the interviews. Workplace barriers to access and utilization of psychosocial services included expectations of workplace productivity, unsupportive management, fear of negative career consequences, lack of organizational recognition of mental health symptoms, services that do not meet aid workers' needs, and limited resources. Facilitators included positive messaging from employers around mental health, referrals to specific providers experienced in serving aid workers, and training managers about mental health and trauma. Future directions and implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",english
25,Assessment and treatment of hoarding disorder in rural-dwelling older adults.,rural; hoarding disorder; evidence-based practice; older adults,"Mary E. Dozier, Emily S. Bower",2022,"Treatment, DD","Current literature on hoarding disorder has been limited to urban areas. This article represents the first depiction of the clinical presentation of hoarding disorder in rural-dwelling older adults. A summary of the quantitative data and qualitative notes from comprehensive assessments with eight older adults living in rural Mississippi is presented and integrated into the existing literature on late-life hoarding assessment and treatment. Participants reported hoarding symptoms of similar severity to previous studies of urban samples, with the main difference being slightly lower clutter levels. Most participants were divorced or had never married. All participants reported having at least one current medical condition, with the most commonly reported diagnosis being high blood pressure. Half of the participants reported that they had experienced at least one intervention from their family; however, only one participant reported ever experiencing an intervention from another source. Several participants declined participation in a sorting/discarding task, suggesting a disconnect between interest in hoarding intervention and willingness to engage in treatment. Future research is needed to determine the efficacy of hoarding interventions in a rural setting and the utility of possible modifications, including greater focus on internal motivating factors or the use of teletherapy as a treatment modality.
